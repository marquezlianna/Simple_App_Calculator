# Create a Simple App Calculator
    # The application will ask the user to choose one of the four math operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division)
    # The application will ask the user for two numbers
    # Display the result
    # The application will ask if the user wants to try again or not.
    # If yes, repeat Step 1.
    # If no, Display “Thank you!” and the program will exit
    # Use Python Function and appropriate Exceptions to capture errors during runtime.
    
def calculator():
    
# Ask the user to input the first and second number
    num1 = float(input("Please enter your first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Please enter your second number: "))
